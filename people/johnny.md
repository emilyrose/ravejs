## music
Johnny is playing lots of music, and hopes to be soon playing regular shows in the Bay Area.  He is on a mission to produce new wonderful events for all ages.

Johnny would like to put together a large loose band of musicians who want to bring the grooves. Johnny plays a big old giant hardwood marching bass drum, along with many other instruments of percussion. He sings, dances, and plays a little synth. (A very little one.)  He also plays code into music.

## code
Johnny has written many low-level signal processing (DSP) modules for JavaScript in general, and the Web Audio API, and a few for webcam/canvas/video.  He uses them for live coding music and visuals, and to produce samples and songs.  Eventually these modules will used to create musical interfaces and bespoke synthesizers.

These two "beta" tracks were coded entirely in Javascript, one live in the browser, using his browserify compatible homemade live coding environment [node.module.club](http://node.module.club):

Most of the other of the tracks have an element of javascript in them.  

### work
Currently Johnny runs Modulhaus, an organization that aims to support the radical free agency of open source hackers, and represent their interests and projects.
