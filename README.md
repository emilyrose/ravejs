# Rave.JS

## Mission Statement

1. To build a community of music lovers, visual artists, and JavaScript hackers.
2. To create shared spaces for community members to practice, collaborate, program, and perform.
3. Build some cool open-source music software in Node.js.

## Motivation

The Bay Area is a nurturing environment in many respects for artists, in terms of providing community spaces/galleries/venues. However, we find it lacking in shared spaces that are specifically for musicians/audio hackers. We’re also (to a certain extent) tired of the typical nightlife scene, and want to explore new forms of entertainment with a more collaborative lean.

We’re also passionate about hacking, and we’re excited to try our hand at building out software and hardware to fill the needs of our community.

## Plan of Attack

We intend to host workshops, talks, and performance events. Initially these will take place in San Francisco and Oakland; in the future, we will expand to other cities.

## Talks

It would be nice to have frequent informal meetups in a comfortable space where we can: hack on music technology; practice music performances; and, most importantly, begin to build a community around music hacking in the Bay area.

Informal meetups would culminate in a series of more formal (I'm picturing tuxedos) Rave.JS Symposium :tm:.
 * events would have awesome speakers, from the community, and from the music industry.
 * hands on workshops, e.g., hack on the lighting system for the rave following the talk.

## Raves

A Rave.js Symposium :tm: culminates in a Rave:
 * it would be a time for people within the community to show off their performances, which they’ve been perfecting throughout the informal meetups.
 * it would also be a time for people within the community to show off their music-oriented hacking projects: experimental ways to collaborate on music, experimental controllers., etc.
 * In a perfect world we’ll manage to combine these various creative ideas with a fun cohesive performance, which gets people moving on the dance floor.


## Sponsors

DigitalOcean: Mikeal indicated that DigitalOcean might be willing to put forward some sponsorship.
SoundCloud: Ben's friend Evan at SoundCloud indicated some initial interest.
GitHub: there used to be quite a few DJs at GitHub, we should see if we can get any interested.
SauceLabs: Nexxy indicagted that SauceLabs might be interested in sponsoring.

## Venues

Any ideas for where we could have talks? Where we could throw a late night event with music without driving any neighbors insane?

## Technology Projects

There’s a lot of room for cool open-source projects to grow out of Rave.JS:

* Collaborative (networked) APCs.
* Lighting that reacts to music.
* Node.js bindings for Jack (https://github.com/jackaudio).
* Something similar to Jack for Node.js.
* The next Ableton?

## Equipment

We currently have access to:

* Mackie ProFX8 mixer
* Chauvet Obey 40 DMX controller
* 4000 watt Behringer Amp
* 2x 800 watt Behringer Eurolive Speakers
* 1600 watt Behringer Eurolive Subwoofer
* 2x speaker stands
* 4x LED par lights
* 1x LED wash panel
* American DJ dekker (the disco ball-like thing)
* Atmospheric lasers
* Haze generator
* all the cables for both speakers & lighting

Is there any equipment that we wish we had?
